            <p>
                <strong>Artist:</strong> Vincent van Gogh<br>
                This painting shows the view from van Gogh's asylum room window at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. It is a powerful piece of <em>Post-Impressionism</em> known for its <ins>emotional honesty</ins> and bold colors. It was not well-known during his lifetime.

            <p>
                <strong>Artist:</strong>Claude Monet<br>
                The name of this painting Impression, soleil levant with the light hand of the journalist <em>L. Leroy</em> became the name of the artistic movement. Today, this iconic work of the impressionist Claude Monet adorns the <ins>Musée Marmottan Monet</ins> in Paris.

            <h3>4. Girl with a Pearl Earring</h3>
            <img src="The girl with pearl earrings.png" alt="Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer" width="300" height="355">
            <p>
                <strong>Artist:</strong> Johannes Vermeer<br>
                Often called the "Mona Lisa of the North," this painting is a masterwork of the <em>Dutch Golden Age</em>. The identity of the girl is unknown, adding to the painting's mystery. It's a <ins>tronie</ins>, a study of a head and shoulders, not a formal portrait. The work was forgotten for centuries before its rediscovery.

            <p>
                <strong>Artist:</strong> Edgar Degas<br>
                Degas was a big fan of ballet, which is why he is called the <em>artist of ballerinas.</em>Today the painting is in the <ins>Pushkin Museum</ins> in Moscow.
